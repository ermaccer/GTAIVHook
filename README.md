# GTAIVHook
 A plugin for Grand Theft Auto IV.


# Installation

GTAIVHook requires Ultimate ASI Loader (https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases). Place GTAIVHook.asi 
in any place where UAL can read it (root folder, scripts/plugins).

Downloads from releases sections have UAL bundled.

GTAIVHook was developed and tested only with the latest Steam version of Grand Theft Auto IV: The Complete Edition (1.2.0.43).


# Issues
- Changing resolution crashes in-game, the setting is saved though.
- If you get a crash on startup, remove imgui.ini file from GTA IV folder.
